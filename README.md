svn-ftp-auto-deploy
===================

Batch php script to facilitate automatic deploy from SVN to FTP.

Synopsis
========

The purpose of this project is to make a one-click deploy after making an SVN commit. This saves a lot of time which would otherwise be spent opening an FTP client and manually uploading each file that was changed with the previous commit(s).
